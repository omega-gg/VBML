# [VBML](README.md) VideoTag

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/VideoTag.md)

A VideoTag is a custom QR Code that contains a VBML file. It can be embedded into a video frame
effectively enabling video navigation between tracks and playlists.

It's text based and relies on a [Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer) to
retrieve video data bytes. As a result it may contain several days of video content compressed into
a single VideoTag. It's also efficient for sharing content from screen to camera without relying on
a central server.
