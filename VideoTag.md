# [VBML](README.md) VideoTag

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/VideoTag.md)

A VideoTag is a custom QR Code that contains a [VBML](https://omega.gg/VBML) file. It can be
embedded into a video frame effectively enabling video navigation between tracks and playlists.

It's text based and relies on a [Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer) to
retrieve video data bytes. As a result it may contain several days of video content compressed into
a single VideoTag. It's also efficient for content sharing in different scenarios, like from a
screen to a camera without relying on a central server.
