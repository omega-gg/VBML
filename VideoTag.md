# [VBML](README.md) VideoTag

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/VideoTag.md)

A VideoTag is a custom QR code that contains [VBML](https://omega.gg/VBML) text. It can be embedded
into a video frame effectively enabling video navigation between tracks and playlists.

It's text based and relies on a [Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer) to
retrieve video data bytes. As a result, it may contain several days of video content compressed
into a single VideoTag. It's also efficient for content sharing in different scenarios.
