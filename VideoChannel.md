# [VBML](README.md) Video Channel

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/VideoChannel.md)

A Video Channel is a VBML based tevolution channel. It's based on a single track of 7 days and
mapped to a specific timezone. It specifies mulitple sources to be played at different timestamps
of the day over an entire week time frame.

It can contain recorded videos or live streams, anything that video a backend is able to parse and
access. It often comes with a default [VideoHub](VideoHub.md) that can be displayed during down
times and gives access to attached feeds or playlists.

Although The [tevolution client](https://omega.gg/tevolution) refers to the actual video frame, a
Video Channel is the video content itself. Effectively mapping an entire week of broadcasting into
a single VBML text file.
