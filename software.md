# [VBML](README.md) Software

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/software.md)

This document is a listing of the different types of software related to VBML. Although, to be fair
it's probably the very development of these tools that inspired VBML in the first place. These
definitions are subject to evolve each time we get a clearer understanding of these new tools.

## Semantic Player

A Semantic Player is a video player designed to stream Internet videos from plain text input. It's
"semantic based" meaning it understands search queries and a dedicated language called [VBML](https://github.com/omega-gg/VBML).
It also parses content from various providers. This tool represents a paradigm shift from file
based media player(s) to text based video playback. It's also primarly built for the Internet as
opposed to the local context of multimedia players. As a result, the question is no longer "*where*
is the file you want to play" but "*what* do you want to play". Essentially moving away from video
file input(s) towards language input(s).

## Video Browser

A Video Browser is a comprehensive [Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer)
designed for desktop computers with a focus on track browsing and editing functionalities. It
supports the core semantic playback together with a comprehensive local library. This enables
playlist(s) and feed(s) creation and provides an efficient way to organize video tracks. It also
comes with additional desktop functionalities like video tabs and drag & drop.

## Remote Video Screen

A Remote Video Screen is a streamlined [Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer)
designed to take streaming requests from a remote player. It supports the core semantic playback
along with a simple server that listens to incoming connections on the network. It has no user
interface because it's designed to be used in conjunction with another player that acts as a remote
controller. It can be seen as a software television screen. Paired with a Semantic Player that acts
like a remote it can be considered as a modern form of television.
