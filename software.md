# [VBML](README.md) Software

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/software.md)

This document is a listing of VBML related software. Although, to be fair it's probably the very
development of these tools that inspired VBML in the first place. These definitions are subject to
evolve each time we get a clearer understanding of these new tools.

## Semantic Player

A Semantic Player is a video player designed to stream Internet videos from simple text queries.
It's "semantic based" meaning it understands search queries and a dedicated language called
[VBML](https://github.com/omega-gg/VBML). It also parses content from various providers. This
tool represents a paradigm shift from file based media player(s) to query based video playback.
It's also primarly built for the Internet as opposed to the local context of multimedia players.
As a result, the question is no longer "*where* is the file you want to play" but "*what* do you
want to play". Essentially moving away from video file input(s) towards language input(s).

## Video Browser

A Video Browser is a comprehensive Semantic Player designed for desktop computers with a focus on
track browsing and editing functionalities. It supports the core semantic playback together with a
comprehensive local library. This enables playlist(s) and feed(s) creation and provides an
efficient way to organize video tracks. It also comes with additional desktop functionalities like
video tabs and drag & drop.
