## Semantic Player

A Semantic Player is a video player designed to stream videos on the Internet from simple text
queries. It's semantic based meaning it understand search queries and a dedicated language called
VBML. It also parses content from various providers. This tool represents a paradigm shift from
file based media player(s) to query based video playback. It's also primarly built for the Internet
as opposed to the local context of multimedia players. As a result of all this the question is no
longer "*where* is the file you want to play" but "*what* do you want to play".

## Video Browser

A Video Browser is a fully featured Semantic Player designed for desktop computers. It supports the
core semantic playback together with a comprehensive local library. This enables playlist(s) and
feed(s) creation and provides an efficient way to organize video tracks. It also comes with
additional desktop functionalities like video tabs and drag & drop.
