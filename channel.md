# [VBML](README.md) tevolution channel

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/VideoChannel.md)

A tevolution channel is a VBML based video channel. It's based on a single track of 7 days and
mapped to a specific timezone. It specifies mulitple sources to be played at different times of the
day over an entire week time frame.

It may contain recorded videos or live streams: anything that a video backend is able to parse and
play. It often comes with a default [VideoHub](VideoHub.md) that can be displayed during down times
and gives access to the attached feeds or playlists.

Although [tevolution](https://omega.gg/tevolution) might refer to the [Remote Video Screen]([https://omega.gg/about/RemoteVideoScreen)
client, a tevolution Channel is the actual video content itself. Effectively mapping an entire week
of broadcasting into a single VBML text file.
