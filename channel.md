# [VBML](README.md) tevolution channel

## english / [fran√ßais](fr/channel.md)

A tevolution channel is a VBML video channel. It's based on a single track of 7 days and mapped to
a specific timezone. It specifies mulitple sources to be played at different times of the day over
the entire week.

It may contain recorded videos or live streams: anything that a video backend is able to parse and
access. It often comes with a default [Video Hub](VideoHub.md) that can be displayed during down
times and gives access to the attached feeds or playlists.

Although [tevolution](https://omega.gg/tevolution) might refer to the [Remote Video Screen](https://omega.gg/about/RemoteVideoScreen)
client, a tevolution Channel is the actual content itself. Effectively mapping an entire week of
broadcasting into a single VBML text file.
