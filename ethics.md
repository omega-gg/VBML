# [VBML](README.md) Ethics

## Motion Freedom

Motion Freedom is a set of ethical principles regarding video streaming on the Internet. These core
principles should be implemented in software tools that are willing to innovate in that direction:

- The freedom to access video resources on the Internet
- The freedom to organize decentralized video sources
- The freedom to share video content with the world

### The freedom to access

The freedom to access means that the user should be able to access video resources with no
intermediary between the software client and the data. In other words, the data bytes should be
accessed directly on the remote server. This should be applied for video sources and related
resources like metadata(s) or subtitles.

### The freedom to organize

The freedom to organize means that the user should be able to organize video sources precisely the
way he wants. For instance he should be able to create Playlist(s) and Feed(s) with decentralized
video content coming from different places on the Internet. Thus enabling him to curate what's
relevant and what's not with his own sensibility.

### The freedom to share

The freedom to share means that the user should be able to share video content with the world.
Whether it's a video resource or a collection of videos like a Playlist or a Feed the user should
be able to play and access these resources in a universal way without third party restrictions.
