## tevolution initiative

Globally, tevolution refers to an initiative that aims to reinvent television.

From a technical standpoint, it leverages modern software coupled with the Internet to achieves
direct access to a comprehensive collection of video streams. Through a simple language called
VBML it enables the user to agregate and curate content freely into tracks and playlists. Due to
this semantic approach these informations can be contained in lightweight QR codes called VideoTag
which allow video navigation and sharing on a broad scale. Lastly it all comes together in the
[Semantic Player](https://omega.gg/about/SemanticPlayer) a client based software ecosystem that
implements state of the art video streaming, VBML and VideoTag support.

From an ethical perspective, it aims at empowering each and every citizen around the world to
create their own media from this new medium. From now on, being a program director is a matter of
writing a VBML document and updating it accordingly. This considerably lowers the bar to create
brand new medias that behave like modern television channels, leveraging modern technology coupled
with efficient individual and collective curation. This perspective is aligned with [Motion Freedom](https://omega.gg/about/MotionFreedom)
ethical principles.

The tevolution initiative is both a technological progress and an anthropological progress.

## tevolution client

Alternatively, tevolution can refer to the application client that acts as a [Remote Video Screen](https://omega.gg/about/RemoteVideoScreen)
and broadcasts VBML content on multiple hardware and platforms.

## tevolution channel

Lastly, tevolution can simply refer to a [tevolution channel](https://omega.gg/about/channel).
